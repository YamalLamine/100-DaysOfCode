    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    

    <h2>This webpage is intended to showcase the knowledge I have in HTML, CSS, and JS, so that I can see what I will work on.</h2>
    <p>So, put your seatbelts on, because this will be a long, but slow ride.</p>

    <h2>My name is Carlo Deuda</h2>
    <p>I am 20 years old, and If I were to describe myself, a guy like me LOVES to learn. Not just read and go on with my life, but to apply and do what I learn</p>

    <h2>I am from Adamson University</h2>
    <p>I am a second year student, currently taking B.S. in Computer Science because I love to create, and being a CS student/programmer is the perfect way for me to be a creator.</p>
